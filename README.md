# lnkstudios.art

simple website that is not very well coded and probably has a bunch of unnecessary stuff and unoptimized af code that i made because i couldn't think of any other way of doing it.
my first genuine html+css project

if broken head to ps://actuallylinkhe.neocities.org/

i don't have money to renew the domain rn so the lnkstudios.art link is broken, use neocities or github.io
