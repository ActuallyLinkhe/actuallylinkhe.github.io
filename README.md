# actuallylinkhe.github.io

simple website that is not very well coded and probably has a bunch of unnecessary stuff in it (i am looking at you css file) that i made because i couldn't think of any other way of doing it.
my first genuine html+css project

if broken head to https://actuallylinkhe.neocities.org/

i don't have money to renew the domain rn so the lnkstudios.art link is broken, use neocities or github.io
