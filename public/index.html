          <p>
              Hi, i'm <span class="purple">Linkhe</span>.
              Also known as <span class="purple">LANIc0re</span>, <span class="purple ">lele da cuca™</span>, <span class="purple">UNSEX PISTOLS</span>, <span class="purple">ゼルダ</span> or <span class="purple">zelda</span>. <br>
              I go by <span class="red">he/she/they</span> pronouns <b class="red">only</b>. <br>
              I'm <span class="yellow">20</span> years old, and I live in <span class="yellow">MG, Brazil</span>. <br>
              I make <span class="pink">dnb/breakcore</span> music (<span class="pink">sometimes</span>). <br>
              I'm still learning english so high chances mistakes WILL be made.
          </p>

          <b><span class="titless">Before you follow:</span></b><br><br>
            Please be wary that, while not strictly containing adult content, <span class="red">I do share suggestive art somewhat frequently.</span> <br>
            I don't mind anyone that interacts with me, nor do I have any "specific" <a href="https://rentry.co/DNInBYFmeaning">DNIs</a>. <span class="yellow">Just be reasonable and not a jerk.</span> <br>
            <span class="red">If you find I blocked you,</span> without you ever even having interacted with me, <span class="red">I most likely blocked you for some silly reason,</span> as I tend to do that a lot. <br>
            <span class="yellow">Just hit me up with a DM somewhere else</span> and if I find that I blocked you for a silly reason, I'll unblock you.
        </p>

        <p class="abt">
            I <span class="purple">mainly use my socials to share opinions</span> about whatever I want to, dont expect any consistency, 
            very frequently I will be talking about something and few mintes later will be talking about something completely different.
            <span class="purple">I also share a LOT of art,</span> of almost anything, <span class="yellow">so I might fill your timeline.</span> I just see something that looks nice and immediatly share/rt it.
        </p>

          I still to plan to add more stuff to this website, so this "under construction" gif probably won't leave anytime soon.
